Things to do still

Admin Dashboard: 
    Create a page where you and your boss can review pending requests, approve or deny them, and directly edit asset information.

    You may want to store these requests in a separate table for review, notify an admin, or log them. This can be done by modifying the request_update route to save the update requests to a "pending updates" table or another notification mechanism.

    When there is an update request, there is an Undefined error


Style
    Make the app look much better


Data tables
    Be able to add new devices to the database
        Can now add and remove devices

    Have the admin table show all the info while the user table show only what is necessary to them
        Done    

    Be able to search/sort by certain column values
        Currently have the search bar that you can interact with. It just does nothing.

        Buttons don't work. When hitting enter, the page updates but nothing changes and the url is now .../admin/assets? instead of .../admin/assets

        Sorting is supposed to be included but its not working

        Want aurocomplete for typing in the value
